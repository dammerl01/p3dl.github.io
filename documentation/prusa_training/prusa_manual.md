# Prusa Training Manual

This document will outline how to print in our lab using the Prusa I3 Mk2. This guide will give you all the
basic information you need to know to get from 3D model to a printed piece.

## Converting model to GCODE
This guide starts assuming that you have a 3D model ready to go. You can either design your own part
from your favorite CAD software, and export it as an STL, or download a model from a source, such
as thingiverse.
\

Now that we have our model, we need to convert it into code that the 3D printer knows how to deal with --g-code.
G-code is a numerical control programming language that will tell the printer exactly how to move in order
to print our piece.
